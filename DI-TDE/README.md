## Introduction:
Durante hace algunos años, DI ha sido uno de mis juegos favoritos de zombis. Pero, se volvió muy fácil y aburrido para jugar. Entonces, ahora, este proyecto está intentando de obtener un juego doloroso-difícil para la raza que quiere realmente disfrutarlo -como Dios manda-.

## Recomendation:

Install [Reshade](https://reshade.me) on Dead Island and use my present (.ini file) to get better graphics.
